                        15 times more likely to develop cancer in the mouth and throat

                        Many patients with lung cancer experience difficulty in
                        swallowing. The medical term for this symptom is dysphagia and
                        refers to any dysfunction in swallowing. Dysphagia can occur due
                        to a number of reasons, including the direct impact of tumors,
                        chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapies such as
                        EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) inhibitors.

                        syndromes associated with lung cancer, and treatments for lung
                        cancer. Yellow skin, itchy skin, easy bruising, swelling, and
                        changes in facial sweating may be seen. If lung cancer has spread
                        to the pancreas or liver, it may cause jaundice. Jaundice is when
                        your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow. It is caused by
                        a build-up of bilirubin in the body.
